Overview [#overview]
********************

Collections pod provides a set of general-purpose persistent collections.
The key feature of these collections is that all of them are const
clasess which return a copy on modification. The main trick is the fact, 
that no full copy is produced, still the old link continues to reference the old version of the collection, i.e. a partial copy takes place to boost the speed of operations. 

The basic idea is taken from Clojure

Collection classes can be compiled to Javascript

This pod uses 'constArray' pod with the simple native array class for the performance needs.

The base item is a const mixin 'ConstColl', it provides a lot of iterable
list-like methods like 'each', 'findAll', 'exclude' and so on.

Other collection mixins are 'ConstColl' descendants.

- 'ConstSeq' is a mixin for a constant sequence of objects.

- 'ConstList' mixin provides constant list routings.

- 'ConstMap' is a mixin for constant maps. It has two implementations provided: 'ConstHashSet' and 'ConstTreeSet'.

- And there is a constant set mixin 'ConstSet', it is based on 'ConstMap', 
and therefore has two implementations as well: 'ConstHashSet' and 'ConstTreeSet'
